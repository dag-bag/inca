              Incancestry is a social enterprise with a mission to empower
              Andean communities and preserve their ancestral textile
              traditions. We do this by giving visibility to the finest artisans
              in these communities and sharing their handcrafted products with
              the world.
              <p className={para.styles}>
                Our focus is on sustainability and fair trade values, which
                means we work to create positive social and economic impact
                while being environmentally responsible. We believe that by
                supporting these artisans and their traditional crafts, we can
                make a real difference not just in their lives but in the Andean
                communities they are part of.
              </p>
              <p className={para.styles}>
                At Incancestry, we are passionate about connecting people with
                products that tell a story and preserve cultural traditions. We
                are committed to being a force for good, both for the artisans
                we work with and the supporters who share our beliefs.
